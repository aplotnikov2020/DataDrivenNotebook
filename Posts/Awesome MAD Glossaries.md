I'm a big fan of precisely defined terms and collect them as a hobby. This is a curated list of glossaries, dictionaries and other services I used to collect high-quality definitions of [[MAD (Machine Learning, AI and Data)]] related terms.

## Scientific papers
[ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics) is a great search engine and categorizer of terms extracted from scientific papers.

## Glossaries
Many SaaS products include a glossary section in their documentation, which covers many terms related to their product. Some of them are hidden gems.

* [90+ KPI examples to keep your company on track](https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/) contains high-quality definitions of 90+ metrics with detailed explanations and calculation formula. Provided by the Geckoboard team.
