Decision intelligence leverages technologies such as machine learning as well as decision workflows to analyze and break down the complex factors and relationships impacting KPIs. The goal of [decision intelligence](https://sisudata.com/blog/unveiling-vision-decision-intelligence) is to help companies make better decisions by leveraging data. The process brings together data, social, and managerial sciences to analyze massive amounts of data at speeds and efficiencies beyond the scope of human capability and traditional business intelligence (BI) to deliver insights when and where stakeholders need them the most.

## My notes
I like the term "Decision intelligence" more than the vague term "Business Analytics." But in the essence, decision intelligence is just what business analytics should turn into in the modern world where we have powerful AI algorithms. So, I'd define Business Analytics as "Decision Intelligence applied to the business context".
