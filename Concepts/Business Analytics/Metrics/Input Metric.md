## The best definition I've found

Input metrics .. measure what we put into a business venture, and what we can control.

Some input metrics such as the number of phone calls made, the number of blog posts written, and the number of hours spent. A good way to look at input metrics is behaviors that you have 100% control over. Since input metrics are 100% dependent on us, these are great metrics to focus on when attempting to move the needles of our output metrics.

Consider the following scenario. We can wake up in the morning and set a goal to **make 5 phone calls** (input/behavior) and the only factor in achieving it or not is ourselves. Waking up and setting a goal of **closing 1 sale** (output/result) is dependent on a whole lot more: making the phone call, someone else actually picking up, listening, then agreeing to buy.

## My Notes
After reading many definitions of input and output metrics, I am still not 100% confident whether a particular metric is an input or output metric. I like the definition "A good way to look at input metrics is behaviors that you have 100% control over", but it is hard to find such behaviors in real life.

For example, the article [Content Marketing Metrics: 23 Metrics to Track Success](https://beomniscient.com/blog/content-marketing-metrics/) proposes 17 [[Output Metric]] and 5 Input Metric (17+5 = 22 actually). Examples of input metrics:
* **Number of X (articles, webinars, etc) published per time period**. True input metric. But still, we have a natural limit on how many articles we can publish and this limit comes from other systems we depend on - human resources and computational power.
* **Cost per article**. Not clear whether cost per article is a 100% input metric, but if we can control how much we pay to copywriters and how many tools we buy, it may be mostly an input metric. But if you run a team of copywriters, cost per article is likely your output metric, isn't it?
* **Backlink velocity** (the speed at which backlinks to your domain or website are added over a specific period of time) looks like mostly an [[Output Metric]] to me. Yes, you can manually add backlinks to your own content, but in the same way, you can grow Daily Active Users (DAU) metric by creating bots and some companies are actually doing this.

Input metrics are essential for [[Root-cause analysis (RCA)]] as they represent actions that may have caused anomalies in the output metrics we observe.
