This is my public thought space about everything related to data engineering, analytics, and running a successful data-driven company.

Coming from a background in mathematics, I'm a big fan of precisely defined terms. I believe that using correct terms appropriately in technical documents or issues may greatly increase communication efficiency and help reuse knowledge gained by the professional community. So I put a lot of effort into dissecting various terms and trying to figure out their essence and practical implications.

The website consists of two sections:
* Concepts - a glossary of terms with definitions and notes on how it relates to other terms and can be applied in practice. It is called "concepts" because it may include pages about people, companies, etc.
* Posts - more or less elaborated ideas referring to concepts to be more rigorous.
